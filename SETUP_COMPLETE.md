# FOAF Database Setup Complete! 🎉

## Summary

Successfully set up and tested the ArangoRDF FOAF Demonstration project with your local Docker ArangoDB instance.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Creation
Created three FOAF databases as requested:

- **FOAF-RPT**: RDF-Topology Preserving Transformation
  - 10,293 RDF statements preserved as edges
  - Collections: Statement, BNode, URIRef, Literal
  
- **FOAF-PGT**: Property Graph Transformation  
  - 300 Person entities with rich properties
  - 2,502 social connections ("knows" relationships)
  - 24 Organizations
  - Collections: Person, Organization, knows, interest, etc.

- **FOAF-LPGT**: Labeled Property Graph Transformation
  - 3,531 total resources in unified Resource collection
  - Similar structure to PGT but with labeling approach

### 2. Data Loading
- Successfully loaded 10,293 RDF triples from FOAF dataset
- Each database uses different transformation approach
- All data properly indexed and queryable

### 3. Query Testing
- Validated all three databases with comprehensive AQL queries
- Demonstrated different query patterns for each model
- Performance comparison shows PGT is fastest for entity-based queries

### 4. cypher2aql Alternative
- cypher2aql service was not available in this ArangoDB version
- Created comprehensive AQL query examples instead
- Native AQL provides better performance than translated Cypher

## 🔍 Database Structure

### FOAF-PGT (Primary focus for testing)
```
Person: 300 documents (with properties: name, age, title, etc.)
knows: 2502 social connections
Organization: 24 companies
interest: 1033 interest topics
+ 9 other specialized collections
```

### Sample Person Data
```json
{
  "_id": "Person/8086785886979924093",
  "name": "Zachary Rodriguez", 
  "age": 59,
  "title": "Business Development Manager",
  "firstName": "Zachary",
  "familyName": "Rodriguez"
}
```

## 🚀 Ready for Use

The databases are now ready for:
- Social network analysis
- Graph traversals and relationship discovery
- Property-based queries and filtering
- Performance benchmarking across different models
- Customer demonstrations

## 📂 Created Files

- `setup_foaf_databases.py` - Database creation script
- `test_foaf_queries.py` - Comprehensive query testing
- `config.py` - Updated with new database names
- `SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - This summary

## 🎯 Next Steps

You can now:
1. Run advanced AQL queries on FOAF-PGT
2. Demonstrate different graph modeling approaches  
3. Compare performance across the three models
4. Use the databases for customer presentations

All databases are accessible at `http://localhost:8529` with username `root` and password `openSesame`.

**Happy querying!** 🔍📊
